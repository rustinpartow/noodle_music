# Song‚ÄëPrompt ¬∑ i_love_lemon

| Field | Draft entry |
|-------|-------------|
| **Working title** | I. love. lemon. |
| **Elevator vibe** | Really CRISP orchestral vibe where the guitar sounds like eager violins dubadeedubadaa dubadadee dubah dah DOO! DOO! like almost off-kilter but not. Crisp. Lots of crisp light fills. Alternating between sad momentary drones and crisp rock. Sounds the way a crisp lager would taste out in sunny Vienna during the summer. **STORYTELLING TONE: Very sideways, posing the question, then distracting from it, then answering it with another question.** |

## **üé∏ CHON-Style Lead Guitar Requirements**

### **CRITICAL: Lead Guitar Must Sound Like CHON**
- **Clean, twinkling tones** - `"electric guitar (clean)"` NOT overdriven
- **Finger tapping techniques** - playful dancing around the fretboard  
- **Slightly jazzy inflections** - complex melodic patterns
- **Fast 8th note patterns** - NOT slow quarter notes
- **Tapping runs in B minor scale** - b8 d8 fis8 a8 b8 d'8 fis'8
- **Clean, precise execution** - math rock precision with emotional warmth

### **The 22+ Seconds Magic Formula**
- **Fast chord progressions**: Bm - D - G - A (i - III - VI - VII)
- **8th note arpeggios** with proper strumming directions
- **CHON-style tapping runs** between chord sections
- **This part sounds incredible** - DO NOT change it to slow quarter notes!

## **üéµ Musical Story Arc**

### **Intro (0-14s): CHON-Style Questioning**
- **Harmonic progression**: Bm - F#m - Em - G (staying in B minor scale)
- **Lead guitar**: Clean arpeggios with CHON-style tapping lines
- **Rhythm guitar**: Sparse chord voicings supporting the uncertainty
- **Drums**: Building anticipation with hi-hat patterns
- **Narrative**: "Here's the question... but what is it exactly?"

### **Section A (14s-47s): THE INCREDIBLE 22+ SECONDS** 
- **WHY IT SOUNDS INCREDIBLE**: Fast chord progressions Bm-D-G-A with proper B minor scale
- **Lead guitar**: CHON-style tapping runs, clean twinkling tones
- **Rhythm guitar**: More confident chord voicings but still questioning
- **Drums**: "Coming, coming, coming" anticipation patterns
- **Narrative**: "Let's talk about this other thing... but wait, what were we asking?"
- **CRITICAL**: DO NOT make this slower or change to quarter notes!

### **Explosion (47s-1min): CHON-Style Clean Power**
- **NOT the real explosion yet** - building energy for the breakdown
- **Lead guitar**: Clean power chords with CHON-style tapping melodies
- **Rhythm guitar**: Supporting power chord voicings
- **Drums**: Heavy snare/kick patterns but NO cymbal crashes yet
- **Narrative**: "Something big is coming..."

### **Breakdown (1min+): CHON-Style Complex Tapping**
- **THIS IS THE REAL CYMBAL EXPLOSION** ü•Åüí•
- **Lead guitar**: Fast B minor scale tapping runs - CHON style complexity
- **Harmonic progression**: Bm - Em - A - D (staying in B minor scale!)
- **Rhythm guitar**: Complex chord support with full distortion
- **Drums**: MASSIVE cymbal crashes on every beat - the payoff!
- **Narrative**: "HERE'S THE REAL QUESTION!" (answered with another question)

### **Return & Finale: CHON-Style Twinkling**
- **Crisp Return**: CHON-style twinkling finale patterns
- Final questioning statement - never fully resolved
- Clean, precise execution with emotional depth

## **üé∏ Instrument Voicing Determination**

### **Lead Guitar - CHON Style**
- **Instrument**: `"electric guitar (clean)"` (CHON's clean, twinkling tone)
- **Volume**: `midiMinimumVolume = #0.2, midiMaximumVolume = #0.6`
- **Technique**: **Finger tapping**, clean arpeggios, jazzy inflections
- **CRITICAL**: **Fast 8th note patterns** - NOT slow quarter notes
- **CRITICAL**: **22+ seconds sounds incredible** - preserve the fast chord progressions

### **Rhythm Guitar** 
- **Instrument**: `"electric guitar (muted)"` (distortion + reverb effect)
- **Volume**: `midiMinimumVolume = #0.3, midiMaximumVolume = #0.7`
- **Technique**: **More chords, fewer single notes** - full chord voicings for soundscapes
- **Role**: Harmonic support, creates questioning atmosphere

### **Bass**
- **Instrument**: `"electric bass (pick)"`
- **Volume**: `midiMinimumVolume = #0.4, midiMaximumVolume = #0.8` (loud and present)
- **Role**: Harmonic movement following the questioning progressions

### **Drums**
- **Explosion placement**: **ONLY in breakdown section** - cymbal crashes for the real payoff
- **Anticipation**: "Coming, coming, coming" patterns leading to the explosion
- **CRITICAL**: Hi-hat and snare patterns for building tension, cymbal crashes for release

## **‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PRODUCTION NOTES**

### **SYSTEM ISSUES THAT MUST BE FIXED**
- **Barcheck warnings**: These should NOT be allowed to happen - system failure
- **7/4 timing discipline**: Every bar must mathematically add up to 7 quarter notes
- **Key tracking**: Need cursor rules to prevent out-of-key note disasters

### **Key Issues FIXED**  
- **Removed A natural notes**: No more Am chords - staying in B minor scale
- **Proper B minor scale**: B-C#-D-E-F#-G-A throughout
- **Restored 22+ seconds magic**: Fast chord progressions Bm-D-G-A
- **CHON-style clean tone**: Electric guitar (clean) for twinkling effect

### **Speed Issues FIXED**
- **Restored fast 8th note patterns** - no more slow quarter notes
- **22+ seconds incredible part preserved** - fast chord progressions
- **CHON-style tapping runs** - proper math rock execution

### **Volume Balance**
- **Lead guitar**: Clean CHON tone (0.2-0.6) - not annoying
- **Rhythm guitar**: Increased to 0.3-0.7 with distortion for soundscapes
- **Bass**: Remains prominent and driving

## **üéØ Critical Insights & Learnings**

1. **22+ seconds sounds incredible** because of fast chord progressions Bm-D-G-A
2. **CHON-style clean tapping** - finger tapping with clean, twinkling tones
3. **Key discipline is critical** - out-of-key notes destroy the musical integrity
4. **Speed matters** - slow quarter notes kill the math rock energy
5. **System issues** - barcheck warnings indicate fundamental timing problems
6. **CHON reference** - clean, slightly jazzy, playful fretboard dancing

## **üö® Rules for Future Development**

### **NEVER DO THESE THINGS AGAIN:**
1. **Don't slow down the 22+ seconds part** - it's the best part of the song
2. **Don't add A natural notes** - we're in B minor, not B natural minor
3. **Don't change fast patterns to slow quarter notes** - kills the energy
4. **Don't ignore barcheck warnings** - they indicate system failures
5. **Don't use overdriven guitar for lead** - CHON uses clean tones

### **ALWAYS DO THESE THINGS:**
1. **Preserve the 22+ seconds magic** - fast Bm-D-G-A progressions
2. **Use CHON-style clean tapping** - finger tapping with clean tones
3. **Stay in B minor scale** - B-C#-D-E-F#-G-A only
4. **Fix barcheck warnings** - proper 7/4 timing discipline
5. **Fast 8th note patterns** - math rock energy and precision

## **Song-Specific Notes**
- **"dubah dah DOO! DOO!"** section becomes the explosive moment at 47 seconds
- **Crispy intro** - no sustain, all staccato attacks for Vienna lager crispness
- **Alternating textures** - gentle soundscapes vs explosive action
- **7/4 time signature** creates the off-kilter but not off-kilter feel
- **Vienna lager vibe** - crisp, light, sunny but with underlying complexity that builds to explosive release

## **CRITICAL Technical Requirements**

### **Lead Guitar Voicing**
- **MUST use "overdriven guitar"** instrument - NOT clean electric guitar
- **Minus the Bear style** - crunchy, driven, but musical
- **B minor scale melodies** with proper 1-3-7 progressions (B-D-A#) for finality
- **NO sloppy timing** - tight, precise execution especially at 45-47 seconds

### **Drum Explosion Requirements**
- **47-second mark**: **MASSIVE CYMBAL CRASHES** on every beat
- **NOT anticipatory** - this is the climactic explosion, not build-up
- **Use cymc (cymbal crash)** notation in LilyPond drummode
- **Hi-hat patterns** throughout for texture and drive
- **Complex patterns** with crashes, hi-hat, snare, and kick

### **Harmonic Structure**
- **Key: B minor** - all melodies and progressions must respect this
- **1-3-7 progressions**: B (root) ‚Üí D (minor third) ‚Üí A# (major seventh) for resolution
- **Scale runs**: B-D-F#-A-A#-D'-F#' for melodic content
- **Chord voicings**: B-D-F# (tonic), D-F#-A (relative major), A#-D'-F#' (dominant seventh)

## **Key Production Notes**
- **Anticipation Build**: Off-beat snare patterns with hi-hat create tension in first 47 seconds
- **Explosive Release**: **CYMBAL CRASHES on every beat** - full intensity, not quiet down
- **Rhythm Guitar Safety**: Harmonize with bass to avoid clashing with lead guitar
- **Natural Sustains**: Short chords with natural decay, not abrupt cuts or artificial extensions
- **Lead Guitar**: Must sound like Minus the Bear - overdriven but musical, NOT robotic or sloppy
