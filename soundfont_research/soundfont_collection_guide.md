- ✅ Drums: Clear, punchy, appropriate kit sounds
- ✅ File size: Efficient rendering times

## Solving User Requirements

### 1. Drum Kit Variety
> **User Rule:** "The default SoundFont only provides the standard drum kit; to access other drum kits (e.g., power kit, room kit) you must load a different SoundFont."

**Solution:** The collection includes numerous dedicated drum soundfonts with specialized kits:
- Industrial kits for heavier genres
- Vintage analog drum sounds  
- Electronic and acoustic variations
- Room-specific ambience options

### 2. Instrument Voicing Quality
> **User Rule:** "Electric guitars should sound realistic and bass should be proper and loud enough—avoiding synth-like, ethereal, or ghastly effects."

**Solution:** Tested soundfonts provide:
- Authentic electric guitar tones (overdriven, distorted)
- Proper bass presence and volume
- Non-synthetic, realistic instrument sounds
- Genre-appropriate character (rock, pop, etc.)
