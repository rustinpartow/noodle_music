# SoundFont Research TODO

## Overview
This folder contains research into a collection of 495 high-quality SoundFonts extracted from `500_Soundfonts_Full_GM_Sets.zip`. The goal is to make this vast collection more useful for music production without requiring exhaustive manual testing.

## Current State
- ‚úÖ **Collection organized** into categories (drums, general, rock, guitar_bass, top_quality)
- ‚úÖ **Initial catalog** created with file sizes and basic categorization
- ‚úÖ **Systematic documentation** started but incomplete
- ‚ùå **No automated testing pipeline** for SoundFont quality assessment
- ‚ùå **No practical integration** with project workflows
- ‚ùå **Giant SoundFont issue unresolved** (569MB melodic-only font can't be used due to missing drums)

## Priority Tasks for Future Agents

### üî• HIGH PRIORITY

#### 1. **Multi-SoundFont Rendering Pipeline**
**Problem:** Premium SoundFonts like `GiantSoundfontV6.4MelodicBank_NoDrums.sf2` (569MB) have amazing melodic instruments but no drums, making them unusable for full band arrangements.

**Solution needed:**
- Create a Makefile target that can render with different SoundFonts per instrument
- Split MIDI into stems (guitar, bass, drums) and render each with optimal SoundFont
- Combine the results into final mix
- This would unlock the premium 200MB+ SoundFonts for production use

**Technical approach:**
```bash
# Example of what needs to be automated:
fluidsynth -ni sf2/GiantSoundfont.sf2 guitar.mid -F guitar.wav
fluidsynth -ni sf2/Drumm_GM.sf2 drums.mid -F drums.wav  
fluidsynth -ni sf2/GiantSoundfont.sf2 bass.mid -F bass.wav
# Mix guitar.wav + drums.wav + bass.wav ‚Üí final.wav
```

#### 2. **Automated SoundFont Quality Testing**
**Problem:** 495 SoundFonts is too many to manually test. Need automated quality assessment.

**Solution needed:**
- Script that tests each SoundFont with a standard MIDI file (guitar, bass, drums, piano)
- Automated analysis of:
  - GM compatibility (does it have all required instruments?)
  - Audio quality metrics (dynamic range, frequency response)
  - File corruption/loading issues
  - Drum kit availability and quality
- Generate quality scores and recommendations

**Deliverable:** `test_all_soundfonts.py` script that outputs ranked recommendations

#### 3. **Project Integration Workflow**
**Problem:** Currently requires manual SoundFont copying and Makefile editing to test options.

**Solution needed:**
- Command-line tool: `./try_soundfont.sh <category> <project_name>`
- Automatically copies top-rated SoundFont from category to project
- Updates project Makefile
- Runs quick demo render
- Allows easy A/B comparison between options

### üîß MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 4. **Smart SoundFont Recommendations**
Based on project analysis:
- Detect genre from LilyPond file (math rock, jazz, classical, etc.)
- Analyze instrumentation (full band vs solo piano, etc.)
- Recommend optimal SoundFont automatically
- Create project templates with pre-selected SoundFonts

#### 5. **Performance Optimization Research**
- Test rendering speed with different SoundFont sizes
- Find the quality/performance sweet spot for iterative work
- Create "fast iteration" vs "final production" SoundFont sets

#### 6. **Specialized Collections**
Extract and test themed collections:
- **Math Rock Kit:** Best guitars + bass + complex drums
- **Jazz Combo:** Piano + bass + brush drums + clean guitar
- **Orchestral:** Full symphonic palette
- **Minimal/Ambient:** Atmospheric pads and textures

### üéØ LOW PRIORITY

#### 7. **Advanced Features**
- SoundFont mixing/layering capabilities
- Custom velocity curves per SoundFont
- Automatic humanization parameter tuning per SoundFont
- Integration with external audio processing (reverb, compression)

## Files in This Directory

### Documentation
- `soundfont_systematic_catalog.md` - Organized catalog with use cases and recommendations
- `soundfont_collection_guide.md` - General guide to the collection
- `soundfont_catalog_raw.txt` - Raw file listing with sizes

### Tools
- `analyze_soundfonts.py` - Basic analysis script (needs expansion)
- `500_Soundfonts_Full_GM_Sets.zip` - Original collection archive

### Collection
- `soundfonts_collection/` - Organized SoundFonts by category
  - `general/` - All-purpose GM sets
  - `drums/` - Drum-specific SoundFonts  
  - `rock/` - Rock/guitar-optimized
  - `guitar_bass/` - String instrument specialists
  - `top_quality/` - Premium large files

## Success Metrics

A future agent should aim to deliver:

1. **One-command SoundFont testing:** `./test_soundfont.sh rock i_love_lemon` ‚Üí instant demo with best rock SoundFont
2. **Multi-SoundFont rendering:** Ability to use Giant SoundFont for melodic + dedicated drums
3. **Quality database:** Ranked list of SoundFonts by use case with objective quality scores
4. **Project templates:** Pre-configured setups for common genres/instrumentations

## Integration with Main Project

The research should feed back into the main noodle_music workflow:
- Update `song_brief_template.md` with SoundFont recommendation section
- Enhance `scaffold_song.py` to auto-select optimal SoundFont
- Create Makefile targets for multi-SoundFont rendering
- Document proven combinations in production guide

## Notes for Future Agents

- **Don't try to test all 495 manually** - focus on automation and smart sampling
- **Priority is practical integration** over comprehensive cataloging  
- **The Giant SoundFont problem is the biggest blocker** - solving multi-SoundFont rendering unlocks massive value
- **Start with the `top_quality/` folder** - likely contains the best candidates
- **Test with real projects** like `i_love_lemon` rather than synthetic examples
